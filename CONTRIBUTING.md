# Contribution Guidelines

We encourage contributions from developers who would like to fix bugs or add features to Steam Audio. If you would like to contribute a bug fix or other improvement to Steam Audio, [open a pull request](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio/pulls). Opening a pull request does not guarantee that the proposed changes will be accepted and/or merged in to the Steam Audio codebase.

By opening a pull request, you agree to license your contribution (if accepted) via the terms of the [Steam Audio license agreement](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio/blob/master/LICENSE.md), or, in case of a contribution to code elements that Valve currently distributes under a free and open-source software (“FOSS”) license, under the terms of the same FOSS license that the current version of the code is subject to.
