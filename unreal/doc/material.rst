Steam Audio Material
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection of properties that define how an object reflects, absorbs, and transmits sound. You can create a separate Material asset for each surface type in your project, then reference it (using the **Material** property of the Steam Audio Geometry component) from all actors that have the corresponding material type.

Steam Audio provides a small library of built-in materials to get you started (see **Plugins/SteamAudio/Content/**)

If the **Material** property of a Steam Audio Geometry component is set to **None**, it will use the project-wide default material, which is specified in the Settings.

If you have a Steam Audio Geometry component with **Export All Children** checked, all of its descendants are considered to have the material assigned to the Steam Audio Geometry.

Low Freq Absorption
    How much sound the material absorbs at low frequencies (up to 800 Hz). 0 = absorbs none of the low frequency sound, 1 = absorbs all of it.

Mid Freq Absorption
    How much sound the material absorbs at middle frequencies (800 Hz - 8 kHz). 0 = absorbs none of the middle frequency sound, 1 = absorbs all of it.

High Freq Absorption
    How much sound the material absorbs at high frequencies (8 kHz and above). 0 = absorbs none of the high frequency sound, 1 = absorbs all of it.

Scattering
    How “rough” the surface is when reflecting sound. 0 = sound is reflected in a perfectly mirror-like manner ("pure specular"), 1 = sound is reflected randomly in all directions ("pure diffuse").

Low Freq Transmission
    How much sound the material transmits at low frequencies (up to 800 Hz). 0 = no low frequency sound passes through, 1 = all of it passes through.

Mid Freq Transmission
    How much sound the material transmits at middle frequencies (800 Hz - 8 kHz). 0 = no middle frequency sound passes through, 1 = all of it passes through.

High Freq Transmission
    How much sound the material transmits at high frequencies (8 kHz and above). 0 = no high frequency sound passes through, 1 = all of it passes through.
